# Retrospective – CI/CD Pipeline

## What Worked
- Successfully created a multi-stage CI pipeline with build and test jobs.
- Implemented matrix for Python 3.10 and 3.11.
- Learned to handle GitHub secrets and placeholder AWS credentials.
- Added dependency caching with actions/cache.
- Learned how to upload artifacts for test logs.
- Captured pipeline behavior and documented it in the README.


## What Didn’t Work 
- Caching did not improve performance for small project due to minimal dependencies.
