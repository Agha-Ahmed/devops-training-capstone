# Week 4 – Day 2 – Simple Reflection

In my current job:
- I do not configure firewall rules.
- Security is mostly managed by IT or platform.

In AWS:
- I manually control who can access my server.
- I must restrict SSH to my IP.
- If I open ports to everyone, the server becomes insecure.

Conclusion:
Cloud gives more power, but also more responsibility.
