Git Branches:
- A separate line of development.
- Instead of working directly on main, you create: feature/setup-app

Why?
1. Keeps main stable
2. Isolates new work
3. Allows review


Pull Request (PR):
A Pull Request is a request to merge your branch into main.
Even if you work alone — you simulate real workflow.

PR includes:
- Description
- Code review
- CI test execution (later)
- Approval
- Merge

Difference Between git commit and git push
- git commit: Saves changes locally
- git push: Sends commits to remote (GitHub)

Preparing Application for CI

To prepare an app for CI:
- App must run locally
- README must explain how to run
- Tests must exist (or simulated)
- Directory structure must be clean
