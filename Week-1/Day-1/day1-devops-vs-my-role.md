# DevOps vs My Current Role

## My Current Role
As an Automation Engineer, I design and implement automated test cases to ensure product quality and verify system functionality and performance.

## DevOps Role
DevOps focuses on the full software lifecycle including:
- Infrastructure provisioning – using Terraform to set up and manage AWS resources
- CI/CD pipelines – creating automated pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Containerization – building application images with Docker
- Container registry – storing and managing images in AWS ECR
- Deployment automation – deploying applications on AWS (App Runner, EC2, EKS)
- Cloud environments – working with core AWS services like IAM, VPC, EC2, and S3
- Monitoring and logging – tracking system performance and logs using AWS CloudWatch


## Key Difference
Automation ensures the product works correctly.  
DevOps ensures the product is built, deployed, and operated efficiently and reliably.
