# devops-training-capstone

## My Goal
I am transitioning from a Software Automation Engineer background into DevOps.  
My goal is to understand CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, Docker, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code so I can build, deploy, and manage scalable systems.

This repository will track my hands-on DevOps learning journey.
